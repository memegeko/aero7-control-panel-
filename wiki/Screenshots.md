# Control Panel Screenshots

These screenshots were captured from the current `linux-control-panel` package
running inside an installed Aero7 virtual machine at its native 1024×768 guest
resolution. They show real pages and live system data rather than design
mockups.

## Control Panel and Getting Started

| Control Panel Home | Getting Started |
| --- | --- |
| [![Control Panel Home](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-home.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-home.png) | [![Getting Started](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-getting-started.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-getting-started.png) |

The home page organizes settings by category. Getting Started provides direct
links to common setup tasks without replacing the normal Control Panel home.

## Networking and Personalization

| Network and Sharing Center | Personalization |
| --- | --- |
| [![Network and Sharing Center](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-network.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-network.png) | [![Personalization](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-personalization.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-personalization.png) |

Network and Sharing Center reads live NetworkManager state. Personalization
lists installed color schemes and links to the desktop, background, sound, and
lock-screen controls.

## Programs and User Accounts

| Programs and Features | User Accounts |
| --- | --- |
| [![Programs and Features](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-programs.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-programs.png) | [![User Accounts](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-user-accounts.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-user-accounts.png) |

Programs and Features presents installed packages as user-facing programs.
User Accounts manages the current account and authenticated account changes.

## Linux Firewall diagnostics

[![Linux Firewall restart diagnostic](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-firewall.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/memegeko/aero7-control-panel-/main/docs/screenshots/control-panel-firewall.png)

This capture shows the safe restart-required state used when a kernel update
has left the running firewall backend without matching modules. Mutation
buttons remain disabled until Aero7 restarts instead of exposing a cryptic
iptables failure.

See the [Control Panel Guide](Control-Panel-Guide) for what each page does and
the [Settings Reference](Settings-Reference) for every searchable setting.
